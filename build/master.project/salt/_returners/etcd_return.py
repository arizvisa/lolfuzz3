Return data to an etcd server or cluster

:depends: - python-etcd

In order to return to an etcd server, a profile should be created in the master
configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my_etcd_config:
      etcd.host: 127.0.0.1
      etcd.port: 2379

It is technically possible to configure etcd without using a profile, but this
is not considered to be a best practice, especially when multiple etcd servers
or clusters are available.

.. code-block:: yaml

    etcd.host: 127.0.0.1
    etcd.port: 2379

Additionally, two more options must be specified in the top-level configuration
in order to use the etcd returner:

.. code-block:: yaml

    etcd.returner: my_etcd_config
    etcd.returner_root: /salt/return

The ``etcd.returner`` option specifies which configuration profile to use. The
``etcd.returner_root`` option specifies the path inside etcd to use as the root
of the returner system.

Once the etcd options are configured, the returner may be used:

CLI Example:

    salt '*' test.ping --return etcd

A username and password can be set:

.. code-block:: yaml

    etcd.username: larry  # Optional; requires etcd.password to be set
    etcd.password: 123pass  # Optional; requires etcd.username to be set

Authentication with username and password, currently requires the
``master`` branch of ``python-etcd``.

You may also specify different roles for read and write operations. First,
create the profiles as specified above. Then add:

.. code-block:: yaml

    etcd.returner_read_profile: my_etcd_read
    etcd.returner_write_profile: my_etcd_write

Etcd Returner Schema
--------------------
The etcd returner has the following schema underneath the path set in the profile:

job
+++
The job key contains the jid of each job that has been returned. Underneath this
job are two special keys. One of them is ".load.p" which contains information
about the job when it was created. The other key is ".lock.p" which is responsible
for whether the job is still valid or it is scheduled to be cleaned up.

The contents if ".lock.p" contains the modificationIndex of the of the ".load.p"
key and when configured via the "etcd.ttl" or "keep_jobs" will have the ttl
applied to it. When this file is expired via the ttl or explicitly removed by
the administrator, the job will then be scheduled for removal.

event
+++++
This key is essentially a namespace for all of the events that are submitted
to Salt. When an event is received, the data for the event is written under
this key using the "tag" parameter at its path. The creationIndex for this key
is then cached in order to determine whether it should be scheduled for
removal or not.

minion.job
++++++++++
Underneath the minion.job key is a list of minions ids. Each minion id contains
the jid of the last job that was returned by the minion. This key is used to
support the external job cache feature of Salt.

event.cache
+++++++++++
Underneath this key is a list of all of the events that were received by the
returner. Each event is identified by its creationIndex when the event was
registered under the "event" key that was described previously. Each event
under this key contains three keys. These are the "id" key, the "tag" key,
and the "lock" key.

The "id" key contains the latest modificationIndex of the most recent event
that was reigstered under the event key. This is used to determine whether
the data for the event has been modified or if the event's tag name collides
with another event.

The "lock" key is responsible for informing the maintenance service that the
event is still in use. If the retuerner is configured via the "etcd.ttl" or
the "keep_jobs" option, this key will have the ttl applied to it. When
the "lock" key has expired or explicitly removed by the administrator, the
event and its tag will be scheduled for removal.

The other key under each event, is the "tag" key. The "tag" key simply
contains the path to the tag that was registered with the event. The value
of the "id" key points to the modificationIndex of this particular path.
